# CommandLine.EasyBuilder

Minimal extensions to the System.CommandLine library that allow a more functional way of building a command line app: visually easier to comprehend, and more DRY

See test project for now for examples.

NOTE: Currently all code is containable in a single file, of approximately 300 lines. Feel free to simply include it in your project, but we've made it a project to allow the simplicity of using nuget and package management.
